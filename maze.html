<center><h1>Solving Maze with Cozmo & Calypso</h1><h3>La Quinta High School - Spring 2019</h3></center>
<b>Objective:</b> In this project, you will try to work effectively with your group (6-7 students per group) to make a Calypso program that helps Cozmo solve a maze. This requires you and your group to apply the knowledge that was taught during Cozmo Days in class into an application.
<br>
To review Calypso materials, please go on <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Calypso/Curriculum/">Professor Touretzky's tutorial on Calypso</a>
<h2>News</h2>
Calypso has been updated recently as it is getting close to the final version. There are more functions added so that you don't need to complete the tasks complicatedly. However, it still has a lot of bugs (ik :[). Therefore, we allow you to interfere Cozmo while it's running to adjust its head or the cubes. <br>
One thing to notice is that the new Calypso is testing a new feature that allows Cozmo to grab the cubes from different sides. It may take Cozmo longer to be able to grab the cube as it moves around a lot to find the perfect position. Please be patient and don't bully him :] 
<h2>Rules</h2>
The program must be <b>completely automated</b>. <br><b>No controller</b> function is accepted.<br>
The only time when you can interfere the process is <b>when Cozmo has troubles</b> recognizing the cubes although they are in its vision.
<h2>Instructions</h2>
Each of the 3 cubes provided in the Cozmo package (#1,#2,#3) will be placed in the maze. They will help guide your way to finish the maze.<br><br>Whenever Cozmo sees a cube, the rules are as follows:
<br>
<b>Cube 1:</b> You can go straight<br>
<b>Cube 2:</b> You can turn left or right<br>
<b>Cube 3:</b> End(game). You can't either turn left, right, nor go straight. You can only go backwards. It could also be the exit of the maze.<br><br>
To go past a cube, you can program Cozmo to go the other way to avoid hitting the cube. You can also grab it up and drop somewhere so it does not block you from moving. Anything works!

<h2>Saving your work</h2>
We have 3 periods of AP Comp. Sci. Principles working on this project at the same time. After you finish with your daily work, please: <br> 
- <b>Save</b> your .calypso file with the following name format: <b>P[period number]G[group number].calypso</b> (For example: <i>P3G3.calypso</i>)<br>
- <b>Upload</b> it on the assignment in <b>Google Classroom</b><br>
- <b>Delete</b> the file <b>on the computer</b><br>
- <b>Create new file</b> on Calypso and make sure that your work is not there.<br><br>
On the next day, simply <b>download</b> the file from Google Classroom to continue working and <b>repeat</b> these steps at the end of the day.<br>
Doing this helps this project to be fair and prevents other groups to "observe" your code. It is absolutely wonderful if you help your friends complete this project and earn extra credit (feel free to do so). However, copying code is not allowed and we are strongly against it.<br>
